Simple SDL2 example for Nintendo Switch using CMake.
====================================================

The example is the devkitpro's switch sdl2 example.
Compile it with cmake:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make nx-cmake.nro
```

now run the .nro with your emulator of choice or on your switch :)
